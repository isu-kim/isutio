## Isutio
Istio Stuffs That I Frequently Use ~~or am forced to be using at a daily basis~~. 

- `infra/`: Simple Vagrant or VM based stuff for Istio environment
- `meshConfig/`: Simple Istio meshConfig for my personal usages

## Disclaimers
- Title image from Kaiber, generated from Istio's official logo (I am not 100% sure if they are [cool about this or not](https://istio.io/v1.12/about/media-resources/))
- Some scripts or some yaml files might be off, those might have potential of resulting catastrophic outcomes and I take no responsibility for that.
